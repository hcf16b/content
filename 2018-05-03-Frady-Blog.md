After looking through my page images, July 1st through July 6th of 1907, I became curious about the Local and General sections. I noticed a mention of marriage and decided to search my files for “marriage”. What peaked my interest was an article within the Local and General section, “A Prison Marriage”. The article mentioned a case against, “Mohaied Bey Ziadi.” Ziadi was the ex-sub-director of Tourah prisons. He breached his duty and secretly married his daughter to Mohamed el Menshawi, while Mohamed was still a prisoner on a 20-year sentence for brigandage. Mohaied claimed to have no knowledge of the marriage. The article notified its readers of the court meeting date being July 6th, 1907. I wish I could have checked later issues to find the verdict! I found that no previous classmates that I could find in the blog archive took similar interests in marriage. The closest related words I could find to marriage were “wife” and “community”. One student, Matthew Cooper, focused on the murder of an enraged husband’s wife. While another student, Brandon Barrett, talked of a close-knit community and the events they attend together, but had no mention of a union.
